   - Add to Backlog column

2. **Prioritize**
   - Assign priority based on impact
   - Move to "Ready for Development"

3. **Fix Bug**
   - Create fix branch
   - Move to "In Progress"
   - Test thoroughly

4. **Review Fix**
   - Create pull request
   - Move to "Review"
   - Ensure fix addresses root cause

5. **Deploy Fix**
   - Merge pull request
   - Move to "Done"
   - Verify fix in production

## ⚙️ Automation

### Issue Automation

- **Auto-assignment**: New issues automatically added to project
- **Auto-labeling**: Type and priority labels assigned based on title/content
- **Status tracking**: Issues start as `ready-for-dev`

### Pull Request Automation

- **In Progress**: PR creation adds `in-progress` label
- **Review Ready**: PR marked ready for review adds `review-needed` label
- **Completion**: Merged PRs are logged for tracking

### Keywords for Auto-labeling

#### Type Detection
- `epic` → `epic` label
- `story` or `user story` → `user-story` label
- `bug` or `fix` → `bug` label
- `doc` or `documentation` → `documentation` label
- `enhancement` or `improvement` → `enhancement` label

#### Priority Detection
- `urgent`, `critical`, `high priority` → `priority:high`
- `low priority`, `nice to have` → `priority:low`
- Default → `priority:medium`

## 📈 Metrics and Reporting

### Key Metrics

- **Velocity**: Stories completed per sprint
- **Cycle Time**: Time from Ready to Done
- **Lead Time**: Time from creation to completion
- **Burndown**: Sprint progress visualization

### Automated Reports

- Weekly progress summaries
- Sprint completion reports
- Blocked items tracking
- Technical debt accumulation

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Issue Creation

1. **Clear Titles**: Use descriptive, action-oriented titles
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Include context, requirements, and acceptance criteria
3. **Proper Labeling**: Use appropriate labels for categorization
4. **Epic Linking**: Reference parent epics when creating user stories

### Development Process

1. **Regular Updates**: Update issue status as work progresses
2. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/user-auth`)
3. **Commit Messages**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages
4. **Pull Requests**: Include context and testing information

### Review Process

1. **Code Review**: Thorough review of all changes
2. **Testing**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Deployment**: Verify changes in target environment

## 🚀 Sprint Planning
